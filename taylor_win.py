def taylor(N, nbar=4, level=-30):
    """
    Return the Taylor window.
    The Taylor window allows for a selectable sidelobe suppression with a 
    minimum broadening. This window is commonly used in radar processing [1].
    Parameters
    ----------
    M : int
        Number of points in the output window. If zero or less, an
        empty array is returned.
    nbar : int
        Number of nearly constant level sidelobes adjacent to the mainlobe
    level : float
        Desired peak sidelobe level in decibels (db) relative to the mainlobe
    Returns
    -------
    out : array
        The window, with the center value normalized to one (the value
        one appears only if the number of samples is odd).
